<h1>Changing Trends in Energy Consumption Across America</h1>
<h3> By: Arnav Pokhrel </h3>

</div>

<div class="overview">
<p> Retail energy sales serve as a measure of total energy consumption over time. As Americans use energy in their daily lives, the EIA tracks how much energy is being sold (and therefore used). These sales represent the amount of electricity consumed by the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. The residential sector is defined by houses and apartments, while the commercial sector is shown by offices, malls, administrative buildings, and other business-forward places. Industrial energy is used by factories and transportation is calculated by looking at the usage of energy for public transportation, airlines, and electric vehicles. By tracking these sales over time, the data defines the habits of how the public is changing its energy usage. Retail energy sales act as a detailed guide through energy consumption, shaping strategies for a more efficient energy future.</p>
<p> Energy consumption in these data sets is measured in “million kilowatt-hours”. A kilowatt-hour (kWh) is a unit used to measure electricity consumption. It represents the amount of energy used when a device with a power of 1,000 watts operates continuously for one hour. This measurement is essential for utility billing, among other energy measurement needs. The large scale of the data may look small on paper, but due to the sheer amounts of kilowatt-hours consumed, a small change has a much larger effect in the real world.
</p>
<p>Energy usage has seen major changes within the last decade, as environmental concerns have led a strong effort to push the public towards clean energy. <a href="https://andywstone.com/about/">Andy Stone</a>, a senior fellow with the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, says that there are still roadblocks before clean energy is fully integrated into American society. “The cost would be the major issue. I also think there is an issue with momentum, and sticking with what people know”. Stone also cites the lack of reputable clean energy sources as a concern for the average home buyer, who may be hesitant about the reliability of solar panels to power a home. </p>
<p>Stone believes that the energy market is not done changing, and that America still has a lot of work to do in order to reduce energy consumption levels across the nation. He points to the known benefits of solar energy, the data coming out about savings available to residents and businesses alike. Stone also recognizes that people may be uncomfortable putting big investments into a home in a post-pandemic world, stating “[COVID-19] definitely put a dent in the growth of energy. People were wary about the volatility of the market”. </p>

<p>How does America change the pre-existing stigma around more efficient energy usage? Stone believes that it is all in the hands of the US Government. “The bottom line is, it’s all political. I think people know what policies need to be written, in terms of tax credits and renewable portfolio standards. Really, the issue is politics. Why don’t these policies go into action? Because there is political opposition to them. It’s as simple as that.” </p>



<p>As we look through the trends in the past decade, it is clear that there is still room for change to happen in the ways that energy is used and consumed.

<h3>West</h3>
<p> In the Pacific, the integration of solar power systems has helped to meet the demand for energy in this area from the period of 2017-2020. While talking about changes needed to reduce energy consumption nationwide Stone noted that California and the rest of the Pacific are one of the few regions that have normalized solar panel use. While more homes and businesses rely on solar energy the number will continue to flatten out over time. </p>

<p>In contrast, the mountain region of the west saw an increase in retail electricity sales. Factors such as longer indoor stays, increased heat requirements, and the ability to rehabilitate work activities increase the use of energy in these areas.

  <div id="south1"></div>
<h3>South</h3>
<p> After COVID-19, two of the three regions in the South experienced an increase in energy consumption. This can be linked to the fact that the South is the region with the most energy consumption out of the industrial sector. Industries are likely to have contributed to the escalated demand for post-pandemic energy.</p>

<p>The rise in energy usage across the South shows the region's reliance on industrial sectors. This pattern reflects the balance between economic growth and energy demands in these areas. Stone expects that the industrial sector will be the first to have widespread adoption of clean energy, stating “[Big Companies] have the resources in terms of knowledge and manpower to run the numbers and to oversee the contracts to make sure they get the good deals that the residential customer does not know about. I think [the commercial sector] is a pretty strong space for solar adoption.”

<h3>Midwest</h3>
<p> The Midwest has also witnessed a rise in energy consumption in the post-pandemic era. Just like the South, the Midwest has a heavy emphasis on the industrial sector (placing second in industrial usage on the graphs below). As the industries rebounded after the pandemic, energy usage followed suit. </p>

<p>However, in the years before the pandemic (2018-2020) both regions in the Midwest were on steady declines in energy usage. A common thought among many energy scientists is the rise of wind energy leading to less consumption. Iowa, a state in the West North Central region, has been on the forefront of wind energy and lowering energy consumption in general. In 2020, Iowa produced over 34 billion kWh of energy just through wind power, showcasing the attention that the state and local governments have put on wind energy. Another West North Central state, North Dakota, leads the nation in wind energy produced per capita. These shifts continue to encourage residents to lessen energy usage, and pre-pandemic levels showed an effort from the residents of the Midwest to lessen the amount of energy used.

<div class="northeast-wrapper">
<div class="northeast">
  <div id="northeast1"></div>
<h3>Northeast</h3>
<p>The Northeast region stands out as the lowest energy consumption out of the four major regions of the United States. To further this breakdown, the New England area has the lowest total out of the 9 regions, and the Middle Atlantic region (which contains New York City, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia) stands out as the area with the lowest energy consumption per capita. These can be traced to the megacity nature of both cities. NYC and Philadelphia have two of the most successful and widely used public transportation systems in the nation with the MTA in New York and SEPTA in Philadelphia. The increased access and awareness of these transportation methods reduces residential energy consumption and translates into transportation energy consumption, which services more people for less energy. The northeast region stands as the end goal for many areas across America looking to reduce energy consumption–a strong public transport system amidst a bustling metropolis. </p>
